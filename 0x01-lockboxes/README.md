## The Lockbox Problem Explained

Imagine you have a series of locked boxes, each potentially containing keys to open other boxes. We want to determine if it's possible to eventually open all the boxes. Here's the breakdown:

**What you're given:**

* A list of lists called `boxes`.
* Each inner list represents a box and contains the keys (numbers) it holds to unlock other boxes.
* The first box (`boxes[0]`) is assumed to be unlocked.

**What you need to find out:**

* Can you, starting with the first box and using the keys you find inside, eventually unlock all the boxes?

**Constraints:**

* Keys are positive integers.
* Some boxes might not have any keys.
* Keys might open boxes that don't exist (numbers higher than the total number of boxes).

**The Goal:**

* Write a function `canUnlockAll(boxes)` that takes the list of boxes and returns `True` if all boxes can be opened eventually, `False` otherwise.

**Examples:**

* `boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]`: Here, box 1 contains a key to box 2, box 2 has a key to box 3, and so on. Since we can eventually unlock all boxes, the function returns `True`.
* `boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]`: This is a more complex scenario. Although keys exist for most boxes, there's no key for box 5. Therefore, the function returns `False` because we can't open all boxes.

This problem requires you to think strategically about how to use the available keys to unlock other boxes and reach all of them eventually.
